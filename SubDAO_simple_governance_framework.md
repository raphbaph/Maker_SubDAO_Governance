# SubDAO Simple Governance Framework
StableLab proposes an easy-to-implement framework that aligns with the natural life cycle of proposals, empowering SubDAO communities with a straightforward way to bootstrap decentralized decision making. 

Building upon Maker Core's best-in-class polling system, and with clean delineation of responsibilities to Maker Core facilitators, the following framework ensures alignment with the principles of the Maker ATLAS.

In this post, we outline our understanding of a proposal's lifecycle and present a simple governance framework for SubDAOs, using off-the-shelf components to speed up implementation.

## Proposal Lifecycle

A proposal begins as an idea, which matures through conversations and soft checks via chats with other community members. When the proposal's author believes it has a decent chance of making an impact and being successful, they share it on the forum.

This is akin to a declaration of intent, addressing key questions:  
* What should be done?
* Why should it be done?
* What specific aspects of the DAO should be improved? 
* Which new projects should be started?

Formal discussions and more rigorous vetting typically takes place as community members respond to the forum post. Many DAOs implement an RFC (Request for Comments) period, a minimum timeframe for a proposal to be open for discussion before it gets put to vote. 

While Maker Core doesn't have a formal "temp-check" process, it does rely on forum discussions to quickly identify and weed out bad proposals.

A formal off-chain poll as a temp-check adds value because it simulates the conditions of the actual on-chain decision later. Authors and Governance Facilitators can gauge community interest and the overall sentiment, and make amends, if necessary.

After a successful temp-check poll, a SubDAO governance decision would enter MakerDAOâ€™s formal polling cycle and be put to vote on the [voting portal](https://vote.makerdao.com). 

Finally, proposals that are ratified by governance token holders are subject to inclusion in an omnibus spell for an Executive Vote.

## Facilitating soft consensus and intent declaration

Ideation is an amorphous process usually taking place outside of any formal system. Our objective is to provide tools that enable prospective proposal authors to quickly gauge community interest and address pressing concerns.

These tools also provide authors with a launch pad for their ideas. More on that later.

### Discord / Group chat setup and moderation

MakerDAO currently uses Discord for discussion, which may change in the future if Maker switches to a more decentralized chat solution. SubDAOs now operate their own Discord servers, some more active than others. Initially, these servers should serve three main purposes:

* Foster general community discussion
* Facilitate focused discussion on governance topics
* Support community building and education

StableLab has seen dozens of Discord servers and identified some best practices for structuring channels so that participants can easily onboard and discuss important topics in the appropriate place.

We advocate for an iterative approach, starting with a few select channels and expanding as it becomes clear which topics are regular and which aren't.

We can collaborate with other Ecosystem Actors designated by governance to handle technical aspects such as TechOps Services, preventing duplicative payments for the same services by the DAO.

We can help assist the moderation of Discord channels and detect potential issues, allowing MakerDAO Core Facilitators to focus on more critical aspects of their work.

### Discourse / Forum setup and moderation

Discourse serves as the default software solution for hosting the forum, where more formal discussions on proposals take plcace.

From our experience, Discourse has some significant drawbacks for DAO decision-making, for example:

1. Comments are hard to resolve fully, as they remain visible, even after the proposal author addressed them.
2. Replies are ranked by incoming time, which means the most valuable replies are often buried.

SubDAO forum discussions have already begun to take place in sections of the main forum. We support this development because it allows the Maker community to discover topics across the whole Core + subDAO ecosystem.

We look to support SubDAO communities and Maker Core Facilitators by:

* Correctly tagging and filing proposals
* Moderating discussions 
* Flagging relevant posts and replies for follow-up by Maker Core Facilitators

We also want to support proposal authors by ensuring the community knows about the *actual* state of a proposal through careful moderation and weekly updates. MakerDAO's famed Governance & Risk Calls were an excellent place for governance participants to get up to speed and for open and frank discussion.

Anonymity requirements have made these calls harder to execute, but there is potential for a similar format.

## Temp-checks and sentiment gauging

We have worked with various soft consensus tools across numerous DAOs and are happy to propose suitable candidates to SubDAO communities.

The concept of temp checks is to provide the community with a quick and effective way to tell a proposal author if his ideas are where they need to be or need more work.

In addition, SubDAO governance can use these tools to conduct regular polls to detect community sentiment. That way, proposal authors would have access to a valuable list of what to work on and ensure governance is about what matters.

StableLab can facilitate and manage these soft consensus tools, posting proposals for a vote, and communicating with the community about polls and their outcomes.

## On-chain voting

MakerDAO is fortunate to operate one of the most time-tested voting procedures and frontends in the entire space. Putting proposals up to vote is and will remain the privilege of Maker Core facilitators for good reason.

StableLab can assist by formatting and vetting proposals from SubDAOs so Maker Core Facilitators can focus on core issues such as proposal alignment and voting schedules.

In the long run, we will explore ways to automate these hand-offs as the DAO and its processes continue to be established.

## Spell creation and executive polls

Successful SubDAO proposals are eventually merged into spells with Maker Core governance output and presented for executive approval by governance token holders.

StableLab can work with other Ecosystem Actors to ensure that the proposal's intent is translated into code and has smart contract development resources to help with spell checking.

It can further prepare copy for Maker Core facilitators to use in executive poll descriptions to streamline and speed up deployments.

## Alignment with ATLAS and Scope Bounded Mutable Artefacts

The team at StableLab boasts a long and storied history with MakerDAO. Both of our founders previously worked at the Maker Foundation and later inside Core Units. Our company has maintained active involvment in the DAO ever since.

We're fully aligned with the Endgame vision and our knowledgeable about its implementation. We're also closely following its rapid development and contribute where we can.

We're particularly excited to leverage our extensive institutional knowledge to ensure that SubDAO governance works towards universal alignment.

We can help ensure:

* Proposals are not out-of-alignment by trying to implement out-of-scope or prohibited endeavours
* Making sure Scope Bounded Mutable Artefacts co-evolve with SubDAOs and guide and support them while reflecting the realities of the market
* Provide concrete language for MIP102 proposals to update scopes or suggest additions to the ATLAS where necessary or helpful
* Create regular reports and Q&As for AVCs and ADs to stay up-to-date

## Summary
StableLab is here to help SubDAOs succeed. We strive to empower SubDAO communities to focus on their unique strengths, while simultaneously aiding in the establishment of robust governance frameworks that supports their decision-making process.


We kindly request incubating SubDAOs to let us know where we can help support them further. We hope that this simple framework is a reasonable basis for further discussion.
